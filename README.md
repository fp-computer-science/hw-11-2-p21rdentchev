### Enumerate & For Loops

---
Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw11-2-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file.

1. Write a function that takes a list as the only parameter. The function should then use a loop and the enumerate method to return only the value of an element at even numbered indexes. (5 pts.)

2. Write a function that takes a list of integers as the only parameter. The function should then use a loop and the enumerate method to return the index and value of any element that is an odd number. (5 pts.)

3. Recall the `find` method for strings works by returning the lowest index in the string where the given substring is found. Therefore: `apple.find("p")` would return `1` because the first occurrence of the substring `p` is at index `1`. A similar find method does not exist for lists as you may recall from our lecture on list methods.

   Write a function called `find_thing` that works for strings or lists. The function should accept 2 parameters, the string or list that is to be searched, and the substring or element that is to be found. The function should return the index that the value was found at. If the value is not in the sequence, the function should return `-1`. (5 pts.)
   
   *HINT: you will need to use a break statement*
